Description: This package provides functions for cleaning and calibrating low-cost 
    sensor data. It is tailored for two-channel PurpleAir sensors. Functions include
    those for inspecting and cleaning PurpleAir data, partitioning data for regression
    for calibration approach, creating multiple calibration models, and evaluating
    models.
